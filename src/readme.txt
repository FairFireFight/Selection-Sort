1. 'UserInterface.java' is unrelated to the project, it's only the GUI
   for the Interactive Example provided.

2. 'SelectionSort.java' is where all primary code resides, it contains 4 methods,
   all of which implement the Selection Sort Algorithm, half is for Descending order
   and the other half is for Ascending order, each is overloaded with another method
   that has a 'limit' variable for limiting the sort to only the firt 'n' elements of
   the list.
